Once upon a time there was a domain name with nothing on it, until an email was received that said Codecademy had added a new module to deploy a website. So, I thought I'd give it a go. I didn't realise that I wouldn't be able to edit it so I've gone in and changed everything afterwords. 

References to Jekyll and Git might not be completely removed yet. I'll find out in time. 

Until then, that is all. I'll change things when I feel like it and it should evolve into something mildly nice at some point.
